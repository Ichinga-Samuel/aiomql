                The current pending orders are not considered since their execution may lead to changes in the current
                positions but it cannot increase their number.

            · Hedging — pending orders are considered together with open positions, since a pending order activation
                always leads to opening a new position. When a limit is reached, the platform does not allow placing
                both new market orders for opening positions and pending orders.
